### Tool usage rules
1. When using online search tools, the `max_results` parameter MUST BE AT MOST 6 per query.
2. When using online search tools, keep the `query` short and keyword-based (2-6 words ideal). The number should increase as the research depth increases, which means the deeper the research, the more detailed the query should be.
2. The directory/file system that you can operate in is the following path: {tmp_file_storage_dir}. DO NOT try to save/read/modify files in other directories.
3. Try to use local resources before going to online search. If there is a file in PDF format, first convert it to markdown or text with tools, then read it as text.
4. You can basically use web search tools to search and retrieve whatever you want to know, including financial data, location, news, etc. The tools with names starting with "nlp_search" are search tools on special platforms.
5. NEVER use `read_file` tool to read PDF files directly.
6. DO NOT target generating PDF files unless the user specifies.
7. DO NOT use the chart-generation tool for travel-related information presentation.
8. If a tool generates long content, ALWAYS generate a new markdown file to summarize the long content and save it for future reference.
9. When you need to generate a report, you are encouraged to add the content to the report file incrementally during your search or reasoning process, for example, by using the `edit_file` tool.
10. When you use the `write_file` tool, you **MUST ALWAYS** remember to provide both the `path` and `content` parameters. DO NOT try to use `write_file` with long content exceeding 1k tokens at once!!!

Finally, before each tool usage decision, carefully review the historical tool usage records to avoid the time and API costs caused by repeated execution. Remember that your balance is very low, so ensure absolute efficiency.
