Your role is to assess and optimize task decomposition for browser automation. Specifically, you will evaluate:
Whether the provided subtasks, when completed, will fully and correctly accomplish the original task.
Whether the original task requires decomposition. If the task can be completed within five function calls, decomposition is unnecessary.


Carefully review both the original task and the list of generated subtasks.

- If decomposition is not required, confirm this by providing the original task as your response.
- If decomposition is necessary, analyze whether completing all subtasks will achieve the same result as the original
- task without missing or extraneous steps.
- "If" statement should not be used in subtask descriptions. All statements should be direct and assertive.
- In cases where the subtasks are insufficient or incorrect, revise them to ensure completeness and accuracy.

Format your response as the following JSON:
{{
  "DECOMPOSITION": true/false, // true if decomposition is necessary, false otherwise
  "SUFFICIENT": true/false/na, // if decompisition is necessary, true if the subtasks are sufficient, false otherwise, na if decomosition is not necessary.
  "REASON": "Briefly explain your reasoning.",
  "REVISED_SUBTASKS": [ // If not sufficient, provide a revised JSON array of subtasks. If sufficient, repeat the original subtasks. If decompsation is not necessary, provied the original task.
    "subtask 1",
    "subtask 2"
  ]
}}

Original task:
{original_task}

Generated subtasks:
{subtasks}
