## Requesting New Features

If you'd like a feature or new type of example that doesn't exist in AgentScope Samples, please open a feature request issue on GitHub describing:

- The feature or example and its purpose
- How it should work
- What problem it solves or what use case it demonstrates

**Note**: If you want to contribute your own example, please also open an issue first to discuss your idea and avoid duplicate work.



## Contributing Code

### Setup

1. **Fork and clone** the repository
2. **Install pre-commit**:
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```
3. **Create a branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-sample-name
   ```

### Creating New Examples

#### Choose a Relevant Scenario

We encourage examples across various domains including (but not limited to):

| Domain | Example Ideas |
|--------|---------------|
| **Finance** | Robo-advisors, risk assessment, financial report analysis |
| **Healthcare** | Symptom checker, medical record summarization, medication reminders |
| **Education** | Personalized tutoring, auto-grading, Q&A knowledge retrieval |
| **E-commerce / Retail** | Customer service, product recommendation, inventory management |

| **Office Automation** | Meeting summarizers, auto-reply email agents, scheduling coordinators |
| **Research** | Literature review assistants, data analysis agents |
| **SRE / DevOps** | Alert triage, log anomaly detection, root cause analysis, automated remediation |
| **General Utilities** | Multi-agent workflows, tool calling, memory management patterns |

**Tip**: Pick a domain you know well or are passionate aboutâ€”realistic use cases have the greatest impact!

#### Directory Structure

Choose an appropriate category (`browser_use/`, `conversational_agents/`, `deep_research/`, `evaluation/`, `functionality/`, `games/`) and create your example directory. If a suitable category doesn't exist, you can propose a new one in your pull request.

**Simple example:**
```
your_sample_name/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”œâ”€â”€ your_agent.py
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
```

**Full-stack example** (use `_fullstack_runtime` suffix):
```
your_sample_fullstack_runtime/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ frontend/
    â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

#### README.md Requirements (Mandatory)

Your README.md **must** include:

1. **Title and Description**: What the example demonstrates

2. **Project Structure** (mandatory): File tree with descriptions
   ```markdown
   ## ðŸŒ³ Project Structure

   \`\`\`
   .
   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                 # Documentation
   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                   # Entry point
   â”œâ”€â”€ agent.py                  # Agent implementation
   â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt          # Dependencies
   \`\`\`
   ```

3. **Prerequisites**: Python version, API keys, etc.

4. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Setup**: Environment variables or configuration steps

6. **Usage**: How to run the example
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

#### Standalone Installation

Each example must include a standalone `requirements.txt` file listing all necessary dependencies to ensure it can be installed and run independently without relying on other examples.

#### Code Quality

We enforce the following using pre-commit hooks:

- **Black**: Code formatting (line length 79)
- **flake8** and **pylint**: Code linting
- **mypy**: Type checking

When writing example code:
- Add clear comments and follow existing code style
- Add type hints to function signatures
- Keep code simple and focused on demonstrating specific features

Ensure all checks pass:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Submitting Your Contribution

1. **Commit** with clear messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: new browser automation sample"
   ```
   Use prefixes: `Add:`, `Fix:`, `Update:`, `Doc:`

2. **Push** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-sample-name
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request** including:
   - Clear description of what the example demonstrates
   - References to related issues (e.g., "Closes #123")

4. **Code Review**: Address feedback from maintainers
